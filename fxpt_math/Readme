The directory \fxpt_math contains the following directories shown below. Directory paths are relative to the home directory C:\...\fxpt_math  

\fxpt_log       - Fixed-point Natural Logarithm function.  The domain of y=fxpt_log(x) is restricted to [0.21 <= x <= 3.45].
\fxpt_exp       - Fixed-point Exponential function.  The domain of y=fxpt_exp(x) is restricted to [-1.24 <= x <= 1.56].
\fxpt_exp_ext   - Fixed-point Exponential function with extended domain.  The domain of y=fxpt_exp_ext(x) is restricted to what can fit in the fixed-point word with length W bits and F fractional bits.
\fxpt_power     - Fixed-point Power function.  The domain w=x^y requires x to be positive real.
\fxpt_utilities - Fixed-point utility functions.

Natural Logarithm 
\fxpt_log\source_code\matlab  -  This directory contains the following Matlab source files:
                      fxpt_log.m  -  This function simulates the hardware natural log computation using multiplicative normalization.
                      fxpt_log_tb.m  - This function tests fxpt_log.m over the restricted domain.
                      fxpt_log_vhdl_code_gen.m  -  This function generates the VHDL component for the log function.  The VHDL files are written to \source_code\vhdl.
                      fxpt_log_vhdl_code_gen_ROM_b_coef.m  -  This function generates the VHDL ROM component for the b coefficients that walk the input x value to 1.
                      fxpt_log_vhdl_code_gen_ROM_lnb_coef.m  -  This function generates the VHDL ROM component for the ln(b) coefficients that walk y to the answer.
\fxpt_log\source_code\vhdl  -  VHDL source files that were generated by fxpt_log_vhdl_code_gen.m  These VHDL files have a suffix showing their dependency on the word length W and the number of fractional bits F.


Note:  This library makes the assumption that you have the following software.  

1. Matlab (R2016b). 
2. Matlab Fixed-Point Designer Toolbox


  Matlab will generate vhdl files given the fixed-point word width (W) and fraction length (F).
